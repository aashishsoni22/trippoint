              The city of Jaipur was founded by King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on November 18, 1727, who
              ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to
              accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai Singh consulted several books on
              architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of
              Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra.

              The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads, offices, and
              palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces,
              with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified
              gates.

              During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of
              Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876. Many of the avenues still remain
              painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.

              In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide boulevards
              were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art
              founded in 1868. The city had three colleges, including a Sanskrit college (1865) and a girls' school
              (1867) opened during the reign of the Maharaja Ram Singh.

              Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of eight
              people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.The floods were caused by three days of cloud burst
              that produced more rain than the annual average.

              The Walled City of Jaipur might soon mark its presence on the world map as Union Minister for Culture
              Mahesh Sharma recently announced that the city is the next proposed site for UNESCO World Heritage
              recognition.

              Referring to this development, Mahesh Sharma said that UNESCO World Heritage recognition is a matter of
              pride, which directly impacts the local economy and boosts domestic and international tourism. This
              eventually leads to building of world-class infrastructure and augments the sale of handlooms, local
              handicrafts, and heritage memorabilia.

              It was in 2015 when the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) submitted a proposal to UNESCO to grant
              Jaipur the heritage status. Since then, it has been in the list; hope this time it gets lucky.

              Jaipur boasts of rich heritage and majestic splendour, and has a blend of history and culture that makes
              it a very interesting destination for discerning travellers. The planning of the city has also been on the
              lines of Lahore, Tunis, and Cairo; the unique layout of streets flanked by colourful shops makes for a
              commendable show of intriguing town planning.

              At present, India boasts of having 37 World Heritage sites. Apart from the proposed site, the state of
              Rajasthan also boasts of having other sites that are already in that list of 37. And those sites are
              Chittorgarh Fort, Kumbhalgarh, Ranthambore Fort, Gagron Fort, Amber Fort, Jaisalmer Fort, Jantar Mantar
              and Keoladeo National Park. So a new addition to the list will definitely augment the list and add to the
              pride of country.

              As per UNESCOâ€™s Operation Guidelines 2017, only one site can be proposed or nominated each year, and this
              year, it is the Walled City of Jaipur.
